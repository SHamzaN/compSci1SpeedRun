    /*
    The do while loop is similar to the while loop, except that the condition is tested at the end of the loop block.
    This means that the loop block is guaranteed to execute at least once, even if the expression is always false.
    This type of loop is called a post-test loop.
    Like its while loop cousin the do while can perform as either a counter-controlled loop or a sentinel-controlled loop.
