        //Information that is stored in the computer's memory is stored as a contiguous series of bytes.
        // These bytes can represent a number, a string, a picture, a chunk of sound, or whatever, as determined by context.
        // It is the responsibility of the data type to inform the computer of the type of data a variable is storing.

        //Different data types require different amounts of memory.
        // The data type informs the computer how much memory is needed for a particular variable.

        //Primitives (Eight basic data types)

        //Numeric values, which can be either integer or floating point
        //
        //Variables which store a single Unicode character
        //
        //Logical variables that can assume the values of true or false
