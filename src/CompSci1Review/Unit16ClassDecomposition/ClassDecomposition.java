 Class vs Object
Beginning programmers are often confused by the terms class and object.
One of the reasons for this confusion is because people tend to use the two terms interchangeably.
There is, however a difference.
To help explain the difference let's look again at our hypothetical school.
Our school was made up of many classes.
One of those classes was the teacher class.
The teacher class describes the role of a teacher, it is in essence a job description.
The teacher class does not teach.
For teaching you need an actual person. Mr. Mueller who teaches math, or Mrs. Ware who teaches science, or Mr. Place who teaches Spanish.
They are the ones who do the teaching. Using computer terminology, these teachers would be objects.
 It is the objects in a program that do the actual work, not the classes.
A class is simply a job description, describing what an object does.

An object is defined by a class. A class is a description, model, or blueprint from which an object is created.
